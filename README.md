# bike-sales-dashboard
Interactive Excel dashboard analyzing bike purchase behavior using demographics and commute data.
This project presents an interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze customer behavior and bike purchase trends. It was designed to simulate a real-world business intelligence scenario, where key demographic and behavioral factors are explored to uncover actionable insights.This project demonstrates my ability to approach data analytically, visualize results effectively, and communicate findings clearly. 
The dashboard allows users to interact with the data using slicers for marital status, region, education level, and occupation. It visualizes patterns in age brackets, average income, and commute distance in relation to bike purchase decisions. This enables decision-makers to explore customer segments and identify high-opportunity groups for targeted marketing or operational improvements.

Key Insights:
1. Middle-aged customers are the most likely to purchase bikes.
2. Customers with shorter commutes (0â€“1 mile) show a significantly higher purchase rate.
3. Male buyers tend to have higher average income than female buyers.
4. Female non-buyers have higher average income than female buyers, suggesting untapped marketing potential.
5. Purchase likelihood decreases as commute distance increases, indicating a need to target urban customers or promote last-mile mobility solutions.
  
Tools:
This project was built using Microsoft Excel, leveraging PivotTables to summarize customer data and PivotCharts to visualize purchase trends. Slicers enabled interactive filtering across dimensions like region and marital status. Custom calculations were used to extract insights such as average income by group.
